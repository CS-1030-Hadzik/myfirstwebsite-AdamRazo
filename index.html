<p>I was born just a few exisgs away from the the instatuiong that we are attending 
this class (weber state davis campus) on Halloween day 2002, pretty much lived in 
utah my entire life. I grew up with my two parents and a sister, many pets over the years.
 I had dog, 2 cats (still have them), many fish, a lizard, a few quails and few chicekns.
  For some reson or anotoher we managed to keep our pets alive for a long time. my dog 14 years
  , my cats 16 and 11 years respefully, the quails 5 years, the chickens 9 years and the the fish 3 years. 
I had attended all the local schools assigned to my address lakeview, Roy jr high and Roy high shcool (All the way though baby).some of my hobbies are video games and languge learning (I suck at both) I have in fact a Duoling streak of 1190 days, My major is just the generals and have a job as a pest control tech for Davis county.
My fututre Job goal is to have a job that can give me a confortable living, and also low on stress, work stays at work, and I can have enough leasure time for anything or anyone. Nothing too high paying, or extravigant.
that is pretty much the basics of my life</p>

<p> like most people I've meet my friends at school and much like other people most have been by my side for at least the past 8 years
    my first friend and one of the most seficiantt is someboby by the name of octaiva formerely known as kevin. I had met her all the way back in kindergraden, we've ben friends since then
some years it was dry and quiet, others we down right hated each other, but mos years we've been those two kid whoes been firends for a long time. still to this day have conteact and still frequenly viset.
Some do wounder when I say "formerly known as Kevin" around 11th grade my firend had come out as transgender, i had known her for most of my life so I wasn't just going to leave her. After a while she got married and livies with her husband who is
great guy, and caring to my friend. As long as she is happy, I'm happy. I'm planning on visit her for many more years to come.  </p>

<center>    <img src="Images/octavia.jpg" alt= "Octavia" width="200" height="200">  </center>
<p>One other friend that I have is a kid by the name of Gage we had fromally met in 2nd grade and by 3rd becaome those firends that seem more like enlemies. we used to fight and we where hard.
    one thing that I remember we did in the play ground, which make me shutter now was grab each other by the collar bone and shake prefuuse. bending arm, finges, and pulling our hair. We have been in a few fights to. but desipte all that we still remaned friends. In fact the school told pur aprents that we are incompatable with eachother,
    close to ten years later and I love prove them how wrong all of the where. As far as his family is concered the mom is pretty nutral about our fendis ship his older sister is the same, his brother is see's me in bright light, his two younger sisiters think I'm the best, finally the father. OH dear.
    where do I start first of all he had a history having the ability to be esaily annoyed, so much so I was in fact the least prefered friend in the small fgroup of firends his son had. So yeah I was the one firend who wasent prefered amoung the others. Anyone who has kids does or will have that one kid you'd prefere your kind to not hang out with.
    none the less my firend still like me and still visted me despide his fathers objections, which is what makes him one of my best friends.

</p>

<p>it would be fair to mention another kid who when by the name of Blain. A clame country kid who came to utah from alsaka, all I know is that we played games together everyday in the summer of 2018, He is an only child his mother a worker at a store I wanna say 
    and his father is a cop who has been stationed in Alaska for the past 5 years, soon to retire. Hes made me laugh so hard and taught me to not take life so serirously I met him later on in 7th grade but he's had just as much as an impact as my other friends mentioned, nothing but good memeories with him.
    We talk periodically once and a while but not as much as we used to, even so we can still pick off where we left off and talk like used to and always have. We acttully care for one another this is why I condiderhime one of my best friends along with the other two. The main three The perfect number not a whole lot but just enough.
</p>
    <center> <img src="Images/Blain.JPG"   </center>
    <center><h2> My family</h2></center>
<p> Coming form a large family and diverse there would be so much to write about each one so, it would be best to befirely descilbe, and give a breif fact about them. staring off with my mother,
    a ntraul born red head who had dark haired children, children that she cares deeply for. She would do anything for them and vice versa truly one the best parents that anyone had. My father,
    a man who came to America from Mexico for a better life and has dreams of going to college after his kid. before then going off to work a wopping three jobs to support his kids through college. Working an average of 
    80 hours a week truly one the best fathers to ask for. My sister she is a college grad from Weber state, she is the more independent one, and in fact the trpuble make among the two of us. She also has a boyfirend, 2 dogs, and a house.
    My cosiun an annyoing but lovable person from the philipines, he ate most of my food. His mom, shes fine. My tio he travels all over the world ans is unintenionally funny. My grnadpa he's not know for being the best father, but we still loved him. He smoke and drank for 60 years and somehow still llived to be 94.
    My grandma she still alive and is even a savage at some points. I have a few cosuines who go to Weber state and such but that pretty much my family. I love my fmaily to the moon and back, i truly don't deserve these people of the life.
    <p> The images are as fallows left to right. My mother, My Father, My sister (and her dog), my cousin Dan, my grandfather, and a good portion of my familiy (inculding my grandma in the blue). </p>

<center><h2> My fondess memories </h2></center>
<p>Just like eveyone else in the world I had made some very pleasent memeories from my past, somethings that bring back a time of zero care and noting
    but the time in my hands. I understant that many thing that we remember are either better then we remember, or seen as simply living in the past. I can see the valitiy of these claims, I still think its good to hold these memeories to our hearts.
    Starting off in school going into a class of 25 kids at most, homework is easy enough to get done in 30 mins. I watch some genearic show on Netflix/TV some of my favorits being spongebob, total drama island, and PBS kids , woundering what these "Hunger Games" ads are. Getting up from all night of playing poptropica, or Xbox. Fighting all night about something some person said in the game.
     waking up, learning I had to do something else for school getting it done. Goint to school laughing with my firends and virtully everyone in that play ground. I remember one point when my FOX 13 did the cool school and the dew tour came as well to us something I would remember forever the only thing I could find is a low qualitiy <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Gl8EHKrBYY> video</a> of that event Im not the video it but Im near would have been around 8 years old, 
     part of what made these so memories is the simplisity and fondness of the past time. Heading into the future with these memeoires inspirese me to give the best for future generations, and possible children. Another reaseon is that it gives me hope for the future,"If I was fine then, then why not now".
     I understand if someone is to read this may have or will have kids in the furtre I would highly recommend the game <a href=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us>minecraft </a> to you and your family, its brough many good memeories from my time and I can gurantee that it would do the same for you and your kids alike.

</p>
<p> More is so much more to my childhood so to keep it short this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Co3TzAtdxp8">video </a>pretty much sums it up</p>
<center> <h2>my time at weber</h2></center>
<p> Starting the summer after high school comeing to Weber State has been filled with excitment, hope and flosrishing. Not to surgar coat anything, it also has been filled with hoplessness, dispair and, fear. I honeslty didn't want anything to do with college, because of being burnt out from 13 years of primary school
    (not sure if im using that word right). However my parents had insited that I would go for at least 1 semester to see how I like it, if not then I would have to
    get s full time job. Neither of those had sounded to galmorus to me, beacuse around the 10th grade I noticed that the harder I tired the more I would be punished,by everyone parents and teachers. So i'd known that there is more to life then work or school.
    However with my parents working their entire lives for me to go and I didn't want to let them down, I didn't have to pay rent or schooling so I was already ahead of some of my peers. I've heard of stor ies of people getting kicked out the day they turn 18 this even happened to my cousin, so I know that I have pretty well.
    Thanks to one taking it slow and two had taken a class with one the sweetest teachers that I've ever met she was paitet and showed me the way around life in college, her name Crystal Giordano. Nothing but smiles and kindness from her. Along with her class I met a few people I still talk to, one is from Japan is he's also very nice 
    and polite. After that class I decided to do a few more classes and see how I feel, did that got a job in the summer (as a pest control tech for the Davis county) and came back to Weber. With some of the most vital classes still ahead of me I was still having a low moral. Still deicied to push through and with those classes done due to the kindess of the teachers I've decide that I might as well stay for the entire ride to aleast an assoicates degree after those classes, and thats where I'am now.

<center><h2>   As of now   </h2></center>
<p2>Finally to wrap up this I like to address how and what I'm doing in the modern times. In terms of college I've decided to stay all the way with at least to an assoicates.
one of the main reasons is because it can only really help me not hurt wheater or not I want to disclose the fact that I have it. I was looking at maube summer courses or more likely my summer job at a mosquito abaitment center, since there are very limited classes you can take in the summer.
My oldest cat is living in my room now for about a year something I don't mind one bit, and my plans to stay at home with parents only grows stronger due to high cost of living and souless housing (not feeling like home). I'm pretty content with a lot in my life right now, I still fear many things of the future, and I suck at time management.
There are only two ways to combat these is for one to carry on to see what the future actully holds and two leanring time management skills. I may stumble upon this project in a few years and wounder "what was all that worrying about?"
