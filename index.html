<center> Yup. Thats me </center>

<p>I was born just a few exisgs away from the the instatuiong that we are attending 
this class (weber state davis campus) oo Halloween day 2002, pretty much lived in 
utah my entire life. I grew up with my two parents and a sisiter, many pets over the years.
 I had dog, 2 cats (still have them), many fish, a lizard, a few quails and few chicekns.
  For some reson or anotoher we managed to keep our pets alive for a long time. my dog 14 years
  , my cats 17 and 11 years respefully, the quails 5 years, the chickens 9 years and the thif fish 3 years. 
I had attended all the local schools dessingtws to my adress lakeview, roy jr high and Roy high shcool (All the way though baby).some of my hobbies are video games and languge learning (I suck at both)
that is pretty much the basics of my life</p>

<center><h2>  friends and family </h2>
</center>



<p> like most people I've meet my friends at school and much like other people most have been by my side for at least the past 8 years
    my first friend and one of the most seficiantt is someboby by the name of octaiva formerely known as kevin. I had met her all the way back in kindergraden, we've ben friends since then
some years it was dry and quiet, others we down right hated each other, but mos years we've been those two kid whoes been firends for a long time. still to this day have conteact and still frequenly viset.
Some do wounder when I say "formerly known as Kevin" around 11th grade my firend had come out as transgender, i had known her for most of my life so I wasn't just going to leave her. After a while she got married and livies with her husband who is
great guy, and caring to my firned. As long as she is happy, I'm happy. I'm planning on see her for many more years to come,  </p>

<center>    <img src="Images/octavia.jpg" alt= "Octavia" width="200" height="200">  </center>
<p>One other firedn that I have is a kid by the name of Gage we had fromally met in 2nd grade and by 3rd becaome those firends that seem more like enlemies. we used to fight and we where hard.
    one thing that i remember we did in the play ground, which make me shutter now was grab each other by the collar bone and shake prefuuse. bending arm, finges, and pulling our hair. We have been in a few fights to. but desipte all that we still remaned friends. In fact the school told pur aprents that we are incompatable with eachother,
    close to ten years later and I love prove them how wrong all of the where. As far as his family is concered the mom is pretty nutral about our fendis ship his older sister is the same, his brother is see's me in bright light, his two younger sisiters think I'm the best, finally the father. OH dear.
    where do I start first of all he had a history having the ability to be esaily annoyed, so much so I was in fact the least prefered friend in the small fgroup of firends his son had. So yeah I was the one firend who wasent prefered amoung the others. Anyone who has kids does or will have that one kid you'd prefere your kind to not hang out with.
    none the less my firend still like me and still visted me despide his fathers objections, which is what makes him one of my best friends.

</p>
<p>it would be fair to mention another kid who when by the name of Blain. A clame country kid who came to utah from alsaka, all I know is that we played games together everyday in the summer of 2018, He is an only child his mother a worker at a store I wanna say 
    and his father is a cop who has been stationed in Alaska for the past 5 years

</p>
<p> coming form a large family and diverse there would be so much to write about each one so, it would be best to befirely descilbe, and give a breif fact about them. staring off with my mother,
    a ntraul born red head who had dark haired children, children that she cares deeply for. She would do anything for them and vice versa truly one the best parents one could ask for. My father,
    a man who came to america from Mexico for a better life and has dreams of going to college after his kid. beofre then going off to work a wopping three jobs to support his kids through college. Working an average of 
    80 hours a week
</p>

<center><h2> My fondess memories </h2></center>
<p>Just like eveyone else in the world I had made some very pleasent memeories from my past, somethings that bring back a time of zero care and noting
    but the time in my hands. I understant that many thing that we remember are either better then we remember, or seen as simply living in the past. I can see the valitiy of these areguments
</p>

<center> <h2>my time at weber</h2></center>
<p> Starting the summer after high school comeing to Weber State has been filled with excitment, hope and flosrishing. Not to surgar coat anything, it also has been filled with hoplessness, dispair and, fear. I honeslty didn't want anything to do with college, because of being burnt out from 13 years of primary school
    (not sure if im using that word right). However my parents had insited that I would go for at least 1 semester to see how I like it, if not then I would have to
    get s full time job. Neither of those had sounded to galmorus to me, beacuse around the 10th grade I noticed that the harder I tired the more I would be punished,by everyone parents and teachers. So i'd known that there is more to life then work or school.
    However with my parents working their entire lives for me to go and I didn't want to let them down, I didn't have to pay rent or schooling so I was already ahead of some of my peers. I've heard of stoies of people getting kicked out the day they turn 18 this even happened to my cousin, so I know that I have pretty well.
    Thanks to one taking it slow and two had taken a class with one the sweetest teachers that I've ever met she was paitet and showed me the way around life in college, her name Crystal Giordano. Nothing but smiles and kindness from her. Along with her class I met a few people I still talk to one is from Japan is he's also very nice 
    and polite. After that class I deided to do a few more classes and see how I feel, did that got a job in the summer and came back. Needing some of the most vital classes ahead of me I was still having a low moral. Still deiced to push thoguh and with those classes I've decide that I might as well stay for the entire ride, and thats where I'am now.
