<p>I was born just a few exisgs away from the the instatuiong that we are attending 
this class (weber state davis campus) oo Halloween day 2002, pretty much lived in 
utah my entire life. I grew up with my two parents and a sisiter, many pets over the years.
 I had dog, 2 cats (still have them), many fish, a lizard, a few quails and few chicekns.
  For some reson or anotoher we managed to keep our pets alive for a long time. my dog 14 years
  , my cats 17 and 11 years respefully, the quails 5 years, the chickens 9 years and the thif fish 3 years. 
I had attended all the local schools dessingtws to my adress lakeview, roy jr high and Roy high shcool (All the way though baby).
that is pretty much the basics of my life</p>

</center>



<p> like most people I've meet my friends at school and much like other people most have been by my side for at least the past 8 years
    my first friend and one of the most seficiantt is someboby by the name of octaiva formerely known as kevin. I had met her all the way back in kindergraden, we've ben friends since then
some years it was dry and quiet, others we down right hated each other, but mos years we've been those two kid whoes been firends for a long time. still to this day have conteact and still frequenly viset.
Some do wounder when I say "formerly known as Kevin" around 11th grade my firend had come out as transgender, i had known her for most of my life so I wasn't just going to leave her. After a while she got married and livies with her husband who is
great guy, and caring to my firned. As long as she is happy, I'm happy. I'm planning on see her for many more years to come,  </p>

<p>One other firedn that I have is a kid by the name of Gage we had fromally met in 2nd grade and by 3rd becaome those firends that seem more like enlemies. we used to fight and we where hard.
    one thing that i remember we did in the play ground, which make me shutter now was grab each other by the collar bone and shake prefuuse. bending arm, finges, and pulling our hair. We have been in a few fights to. but desipte all that we still remaned friends. In fact the school told pur aprents that we are incompatable with eachother,
    close to ten years later and I love prove them how wrong all of the where. As far as his family is concered the mom is pretty nutral about our fendis ship his older sister is the same, his brother is see's me in bright light, his two younger sisiters think I'm the best, finally the father. OH dear.
    where do I start first of all he had a history having the ability to be esaily annoyed, so much so
